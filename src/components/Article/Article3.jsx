                <p>Play-to-earn (play to earn) is a game that allows its users to play games while generating stable crypto income.</p>
                <p>Even though the mechanism for each game is different, it is certain that users will get income from staking, farming game currency,
                    or NFT assets that can be traded in various favorite marketplaces.</p>
                <p>This makes a fundamental difference to the older generation of blockchain games. Here, the users rely 
                    entirely on the advantage of random chance.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, play-to-earn games have succeeded in creating a digital economy in games, plus the concept is similar to 
                    a virtual business that allows players to work while making money.</p>

                    included in the GameFi category, for example HeroCatGameFi.</p> 
                <p>Interestingly, these types of games always use the grinding aspect, or in other words repeating certain actions so 
                    that players can make the same profit.</p>
