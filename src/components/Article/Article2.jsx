                <p>Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs are digital assets with unique metadata attached to the token. The tokens can be used for digital collections, 
                    voting, or other forms of governance applications and in the form of games.</p>
                <p>The term 'fungible' means that if we exchange or trade with other bitcoins, then we will have the equivalent
                    or the exact same thing. While the term 'non fungible' is the opposite, we will get something completely different.</p>
                <p>NFTs are also often considered intangible private property, because they are digital assets.</p>
                <h3>How NFT Works</h3>
                <p>NFT is used in the Ethereum blockchain which is a crypto currency, like bitcoin. That is, NFTs cannot exist
                    outside the blockchain ecosystem, because they do not exist independently.</p> 
                <p>The Ethereum blockchain will support NFT trading using ETH as their currency.</p>
                <p>The way NFT works is that its digital data storage system, will allow users to transfer data secretly to each other, through encryption schemes in cryptography, so that data cannot be 
                    tracked and owned by other users, because they do not own the data.</p>
                <h3>How to make NFT?</h3>
                <p>NFT can be created in various ways, this depends on the context in which the token is used. easy way to create NFT is to upload file with metadata as "JSON"
                    object and use same value as string to identify token.</p>     
                <p>It can help in using existing infrastructure, including wallets and exchanges without much modification.</p>
                <p>NFT is considered promising because in 2021 the creative industry in Indonesia, the development of NFT in Indonesia has attracted the attention of various
                    artists ranging from musicians, painters, photographers, and others.</p>
