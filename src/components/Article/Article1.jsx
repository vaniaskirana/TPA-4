                <p>GameFi is a play-to-earn blockchain game that offers players economic incentives. Usually, players can earn
                    cryptocurrency and NFT rewards by completing tasks, battling other players, and progressing through different game levels.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional video games, most blockchain games allow transferring game items outside the virtual game world. It supports players to trade items on the 
                    NFT marketplace and their crypto earnings on crypto exchanges.</p>
                <h3>What is GameFi?</h3>
                <p>GameFi is a mixture of the words "game" (game) and "finance" (finance). The term refers to a play-to-earn blockchain game that offers players an economic incentive. 
                    The GameFi ecosystem uses cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and blockchain technology to create virtual gaming environments.</p> 
                <p>Usually, players can earn in-game rewards by completing tasks, battling other players, and progressing through various game levels.
                    They can also transfer non-gaming assets to crypto exchanges and NFT marketplaces.</p>
                <h3>How does GameFi work?</h3>
                <p>In GameFi, rewards can take many forms, such as crypto currency or in-game assets such as virtual lands, avatars, weapons, and costumes. Each GameFi project will adopt a different gaming economy and model. In most of the cases, the in-game assets
                    are NFTs running on the blockchain. This means that these assets can be used in the NFT marketplace.</p>     
                <p>However, in other cases, in-game assets must be converted to NFT before players can trade or sell them.
                    Usually, the in-game assets will provide certain benefits to players thereby allowing them to earn more rewards. However, some games also have avatars and cosmetics
                    which are purely visual in nature and have no influence on gameplay and gameplay.</p>
